# FLAGS
In this challenge i was given with an image:

I understood that this was the format of a flag by looking at the brackets.
I did a bit of digging and found out that these are maritime signal flags used for communication at sea. Each flag represents a letter of the alphabet or has a specific meaning.

I went to wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags) and found out what each flag meant and their letter/radio name.
The first 7 flags had the letter PICOCTF and now it was clear that the flags inside the brackets were the contents of the actual flag.
So i matched the flag with each letter and got the flag:
### Flag:
>PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}
