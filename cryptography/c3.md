# C3
In this challenge i had been given with a ciphertext :"DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"
and the code for the encoder :
```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
initially i just tried giving the ciphertext as input to the encoder but that was dumb since it was the encoder it didnt do anything just gave me errors since half the characters in the ciphertext were not there in lookup1.

Since i have the encoder i figured that i would need a decoder now so i reversed the code:
```
chars="DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  o=(cur + prev) % 40
  out += lookup1[o]
  prev = o

print(out)
```
Initially i had tried to just reverse the logic inside the for loop and keep rest of the things the same but it kept giving me a value error during input as whenever i pressed ctrl+d after the input it gave me an error because \n wasnt there in lookup2 and adding it to lookup2 just creates a mess.

So i gave the ciphertext as input directly in chars which gave me another program :
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
The program was in python 2 version which was outdated so i converted it to python 3:
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print(chars[i]) #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
Since selfinput in written in the comments of the program i tried giving the program itself as input and it produced the output:
```
a
d
l
i
b
t
```
The flag was wrong so i tried giving the python 2 version of the program as input to the new program and got the output :
```
a
d
l
i
b
s
```
this was correct, earlier t came instead of s because of an extra index of the brackets but now its fixed
