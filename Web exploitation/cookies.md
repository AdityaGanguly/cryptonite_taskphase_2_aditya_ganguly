# cookies
### Explanation :
 In this challenge i had to go to "http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/" and find out what the best cookie is.

 Initially i tried entering some cookie names like snickerdoodle,chocolate chip, etc. but they gave me the output that the cookie is not special enough:

 Then i went into developer tools and in the application in the cookies section, there i saw a cookie named 'name' which had a value -1 on the home screen and 0 on the snickerdoodle screen and for every different value would show a different output screen:

So i did hit and trial with different values 1,2,3.... and got the cookie at value 18 which displayed the flag
