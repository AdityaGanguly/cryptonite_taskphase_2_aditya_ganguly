# POWER COOKIE
This challenge gives us the link to a website and upon going there we see this :

So i clicked continue as guest and got the output as "We apologize, but we have no guest services at the moment"

Due to my previous knowledge of these user based website challenges i knew that i had to become an admin from guest somehow.

So i went to developer tools and then applications and then the cookies and saw a cookie named isAdmin whose value was set to 0.

So i changes the value of this cookie from 0 to 1 and got the flag.
