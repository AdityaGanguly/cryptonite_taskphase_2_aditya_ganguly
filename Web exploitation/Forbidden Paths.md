# Forbidden Paths
### Explanation: 
In this challenge the given website filters files by absolute paths so we have to use relative paths to access flag.txt.

The absolute path is : /usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt

So i used ../ and wrote the relative path as : ../../../../flag.txt

I used ../ 4 times sinnce i needed to move up by 4 levels(../ basically means to move up by one level from the current directory/location)
