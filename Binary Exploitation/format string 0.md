### Explanation:
Firstly i connected with the challenge instance i entered nc mimas.picoctf.net 58316 on the linux terminal.

In this challenge i had to select what food to make for patrick and bob which i tried to understand from thr c program file that was given but could'nt so i started hit and trial method.

Firstly i fed patrick the Bac0n_D3luxe but it seems it was the wrong option since he was still hungry.

i started again and this time fed him the Gr%114d_Cheese which was correct since patrick was happy.

Now i had to decide food for bob and decided to give him Cla%sic_Che%s%steak which was the correct option since it displayed the flag.
